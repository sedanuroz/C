Software Requirements
The basic operation that the restaurant expects from the software is as follows:
 Customers coming to the restaurant should be seated at a table. Here, each table has an ID.
 The restaurant owner should be able to add new tables or remove existing one in the restaurant.
 The food menu should be presented to the customer so that customer can order. The menu must include the ID, name and fee
of each food.
 The restaurant owner should be able to update the fee for an existing food later.
 When ordering, the customer must provide table ID, food ID and how many of this food customer wants.
 The order must be submitted to the business's request and, if the order is approved by the business, it must be added to the
table's order list.
 Orders must be taken from only one table at a time and must be submitted for approval.
 The customer should be able to cancel the order later if customer wishes.
 The customer should be able to change the quantity of the order if customer wishes.
 Both the customer and the restaurant owner should be able to instantly view the order list for a table.
 At the end of the food the customer must pay the total amount. For this, customer is asked for the table ID. Only foods that
have not been canceled must be paid for at checkout.
 After payment is made, the order list for the table must be deleted and the table must be made ready for new customers.
 The restaurant owner should be able to check the total payment amounts on the screen at the end of the day.
